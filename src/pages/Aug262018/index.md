This week, I wanted to do a preview of what is upcoming in VS Code as well as some community spotlight and a quick tip. The endgame for VS Code August 2018 is starting tomorrow and with such, we are approaching a new update and let's take a look at what is going stable in the coming weeks.

# VS Code Feature Spotlight: v1.27 Preview

The biggest feature that is upcoming is the new Settings View. It is taking a stark change from the JSON format that existed up to this point.

Do note if you still prefer the JSON format that it is not going away and you can easily access it by running the 'Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)' action in the command palette.

If you want to test these features while they are in development, head over to the VS Code Website to the [Download VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) page.
