This week, I wanted to do a preview of what is upcoming in VS Code as well as some community spotlight and a quick tip. The endgame for VS Code August 2018 is starting tomorrow and with such, we are approaching a new update and let's take a look at what is going stable in the coming weeks.

# VS Code Feature Spotlight: v1.27 Preview

The biggest feature that is upcoming is the new Settings View. It is taking a stark change from the JSON format that existed up to this point.

Do note if you still prefer the JSON format that it is not going away and you can easily access it by running the 'Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)' action in the command palette.

If you want to test these features while they are in development, head over to the VS Code Website to the [Download VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) page.

# Community Spotlight: Clock in Status Bar and Auto Rename Tag

![clock in status bar](Clock.png)

[Clock in status bar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.vscode-clock) is a clean addition to VS Code by adding just what it says: a digital clock into the status bar in the bottom right corner. If you click on it, it will copy the current time into the clipboard as it is presented on your statusbar. When working on MacOS and having the editor in full screen mode, having a clock on my screen without needing to move the mouse up to the menu bar brings a pleasant touch to daily development.

The second extension we are looking at is [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag). It's an extremely simple yet powerful extension that has a single function of renaming matching tags in HTML or XML files. In practice it mainly just works other than some times where it grabs the incorrect closing tag. That said, it is a extension that is simplistic at design and doesn't add any bloat and it seems to act as if it was native to the editor as I have used it.
