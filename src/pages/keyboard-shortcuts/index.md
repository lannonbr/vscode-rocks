Talk about keyboard shortcuts to increase productivity to VS Code

<!-- end -->

I used vim previously before switching to VS Code and the vim philosophy is to continually use keyboard shortcuts to make programming much faster as you become more advanced in vim. Switching to VS Code, it is more visually based, but as I show here, the majority of the editor can be controlled with the keyboard alone.

# Command Palette: cmd/ctrl+shift+p or F1

One of the most powerful keyboard shortcuts is to open the command palette with ctrl/cmd + shift + p. Absolutely any action you can do with a mouse is actionable through the command palette. start typing whatever you wish to do and it will appear in the search results. As well, on the right side of any action, if it has a mapped keybinding, it will present it to you.

For things you use frequently including a majority of things that will be discussed later in this article, learning those keyboard shortcuts will make it much easier rather than searching for it time and time again.

# File Palette: cmd/ctrl+p

Last week, I mentioned this keyboard shortcut

# Zen Mode: cmd/ctrl+k z

When wanting to get into the zone, VS Code's native zen mode will help out with such. It gets rid of the sidebar, tabs, goes fullscreen, and pushes everything away to allow for a distraction free environment. If you have a split editor, it will keep those splits open in zen mode which can be useful at times, but a personal feature request I would like to see in VS Code is a zen mode with only one editor visible.
